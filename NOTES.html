<h1>Why</h1>

<h2>Module::Starter</h2>

<p>By default uses inline templates. To get editable templates need to setup
a config like this:</p>

<pre><code>.module-starter/config:
    builder: Module::Build
    author:  Mark Grimes
    email:   mgrimes@cpan.org
    plugins: Module::Starter::Simple Module::Starter::Plugin::Template Module::Starter::Plugin::DirStore Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2
    template_dir: /Users/mgrimes/.module-starter/skel
    template_parms: ''
</code></pre>

<p>Took years to stumble upon that config. Still has a number of issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>all tests put in <code>t/</code></li>
<li><code>.gitignore</code> not created </li>
<li>can't have arbitrary files/directories (ie, <code>script/app.pl</code> or <code>sample/usage.pl</code>)</li>
<li><em>can't update once initially created</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Module::Starter::PBP solves some of these, but you still can't put author tests
in <code>xt/</code> or have arbitrary directories/files. You also can't create a new
module in the distribution after it is initialized, and you are on your own
for updating boilerplate after it is initialized.</p>

<h2>Module::Setup</h2>

<p>Module::Setup is a great improvement over Module::Starter. It is easily to edit
the template files. It has support for multiple flavors, plugins to initialize
a git repository, and the ability to  package and share templates. I was in 
the process of switching to <code>module-setup</code>, but I realized I really want the
ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate a new module <em>after</em> the distribution has been created</li>
<li>update the distribution if I improve the templates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dist::Zilla</h2>

<p>It really is a monster. If you can get it working for you, it is incredibly
powerful, but I Spent ton of time creating a <code>dist.ini</code> that would allow me to
work the way I wanted. Here is what I ended up with:</p>

<pre><code>dist.ini:

name    = App-EditorTools
author  = Mark Grimes &lt;mgrimes@cpan.org&gt;
license = Perl_5
copyright_holder = Mark Grimes

; Get files and craete the MANIFEST

[PruneCruft]
[PruneFiles]
filenames = local
filenames = dist.ini
[Manifest]
; Might use this (and a MANIFEST.SKIP file) this instead of [PruneCruft]
; [ManifestSkip]

; Create the Build.PL

</code></pre>

<p><code>&lt;kidding&gt;</code>Ok. So now I need a templating tool to recreate the <code>dist.ini</code> for
each project!<code>&lt;/kidding&gt;</code> What I really need is my own bundle. Had to dig
around to figure out how to do that. I heard it is getting easier, but should I
really have to have a release on CPAN just to template a new module? And before
I knew it, I was investing in writing plugins to get my preferred module
versioning and automating the update of Changes.</p>

<p>All that, I there are still problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>What if I want to run author tests during development? Why should <code>dzil</code> be
involved? What if I want to run just one author test?</li>
<li>Need to run build before xtests</li>
<li>Can't easily pass options to many plugins (Test::Kwalitee)</li>
<li>Inserts code before strictures breaking Perl::Critic</li>
<li>Pod::Coverage::TrustPod barfs w/ unmatched (</li>
</ul>
